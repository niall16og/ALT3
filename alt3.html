                <h2>Analysis of Brief</h2>
                <p>In our brief we are asked to develop a model which allows different scenarios to be tested. We were also asked to be able to analyse and interpret the outcomes of the simulation both before and after modifications had been made.</p>
				<p>The benefits of using agent based modelling (ABM) is that it can help describe complex environments from a swarm of bees to motorists in traffic by applying a simple set of rules to each individual's behaviour.  <p>
                <p>In addition, if the agents or the environment are new and perhaps untested, ABMâ€™s can be used for simulation to examine emergent behaviours. These are behaviours that are observed in the environment as a whole but are not observed in the individual agents. The behaviours only emerge when the agents interact in the environment. <p>

                <h2>Research and Investigation</h2>
                <p>At the beginning of the project we thought that we would be able to import the premier-league python library so we could import the results for the games. However when we ran this in python the request for this library was unsuccessful. We managed to find a workaround by importing the data through an already established api. From the website: https://www.football-data.org/ we were able to retrieve the results for all premier league games. </p>
                <p>We also needed to programme code that could then calculate the probability based on these results. We learned we would need to use if/elif/else statements to determine the form and probability of a certain team winning. We also ran into a road block when we realised we never coded anything in for if the teams had equal results. We resolved this by adding an else statement which added a â€˜drawâ€™ variable to the code<p>
				<p>For our html code we used a past website from a previous alt. This would reduce the time of coding the website drastically.  However in researching the previous code we realised that there was a problem with the content as each section showed the same content. We resolved this by changing the classification of each page and using javascript to hide the other sections.<p>

				<h3>Modelling and Simulation Idea</h3>
                <p>The modelling and simulation idea that we had was a model to simulate the match result between two teams to predict the most likely outcome, (win, lose or draw), based on various factors of previous performance, such as recent form.</p>
				<h3>What we chose</h3>
                <p>The model we have made is a statistical model that operates on various factors in the past performance of both teams, analysing them to produce an output. </p>
				<p>We have chosen this model idea because we find it to be an interesting area to explore and believe it will present some interesting challenges that will both be difficult but achievable to overcome.</p>
				<p>The primary thing we are focusing on in this model is the recent form of each team over the five previous games and applying certain weightings to each game.</p>
				<p>The primary scenario would be when one team has a better form than the other team, then the model would show them as the most likely to win. Another example of a scenario would be if both teams have an equal form, then the model should show the most likely outcome as a draw.</p>
				<p>The system will fetch the recent games of each team and assign different weightings to their result. Based on this each team will receive a form rating and the probability of each outcome of the match is calculated based on these ratings.</p>
				<h3>Pseudocode</h3>
				<p>Fetch data<br>
				For each match - apply weighting to result based on recency<br>
				Calculate form ratings<br>
				Incorporate points per game and previous head-to-head with form ratings<br>
				Compare form ratings and determine most likely result<br>
				Calculate probabilities for each outcome<br>
				Output results</p>

                <p>On finishing the project we managed to complete our goals of creating a programme that retrieves data and is able to compute the different results of each team</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create code that enables us to retrieve results.  - we were able to create a programme that retrieves the results of teams from an already established website</li>
                    <li>Calculate the form based on the results. - after we retrieve the results we the were able to use more python code to calculate the form of each team and how they compare with each other</li>
                    <li>Finally, we were able to use code to tell the user  which team is better and why they are the better team</li>
                </ul>
				
				<p>To evaluate we believe that we completed all our goals that we set out to do at the beginning of the ALT<p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>Looking back on our project there are obviously things we would have done differently. If we were to do it again we would have probably altered the code so that it could be used on many different teams instead of 2 set ones. Also, if we had more time on our Alt we would have added more different and complex variables to our code. Another element we could have changed is having more user interaction. Using the code the user is only asked to input the team names and they have the results, we could have also got them to save their results and compare them later on in the year if we had more time.</p>
